# Shoulda Matchers [![Gem Version][version-badge]][rubygems] [![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis] ![Downloads][downloads-badge]

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/shoulda-matchers/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/shoulda-matchers/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/shoulda-matchers/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Shoulda Matchers provides RSpec- and Minitest-compatible one-liners that test
common Rails functionality. These tests would otherwise be much longer, more
complex, and error-prone.

## Getting started

### RSpec

Include `shoulda-matchers` in your Gemfile:

For Rails 4.x:

``` ruby
group :test do
  gem 'shoulda-matchers', '~> 3.1'
end
```

For Rails 5.0:

``` ruby
group :test do
 Â gem 'shoulda-matchers', git: 'https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers.git', branch: 'rails-5'
end
```

Now you need to tell the gem a couple of things:

* Which test framework you're using
* Which portion of the matchers you want to use

You can supply this information by using a configuration block. Place the
following in `rails_helper.rb`:

``` ruby
Shoulda::Matchers.configure do |config|
  config.integrate do |with|
    # Choose a test framework:
    with.test_framework :rspec
    with.test_framework :minitest
    with.test_framework :minitest_4
    with.test_framework :test_unit

    # Choose one or more libraries:
    with.library :active_record
    with.library :active_model
    with.library :action_controller
    # Or, choose the following (which implies all of the above):
    with.library :rails
  end
end
```

Now you can use matchers in your tests. For instance a model test might look
like this:

``` ruby
RSpec.describe Person, type: :model do
  it { should validate_presence_of(:name) }
end
```

#### Availability of matchers in various example groups

Since shoulda-matchers provides four categories of matchers, there are four
different levels where you can use these matchers:

* ActiveRecord and ActiveModel matchers are available only in model example
  groups, i.e., those tagged with `type: :model` or in files located under
  `spec/models`.
* ActionController matchers are available only in controller example groups,
  i.e., those tagged with `type: :controller` or in files located under
  `spec/controllers`.
* The `route` matcher is available also in routing example groups, i.e., those
  tagged with `type: :routing` or in files located under `spec/routing`.
* Independent matchers are available in all example groups.

**If you are using ActiveModel or ActiveRecord outside of Rails** and you want
to use model matchers in certain example groups, you'll need to manually include
them. Here's a good way of doing that:

``` ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include(Shoulda::Matchers::ActiveModel, type: :model)
  config.include(Shoulda::Matchers::ActiveRecord, type: :model)
end
```

Then you can say:

``` ruby
describe MySpecialModel, type: :model do
  # ...
end
```

#### `should` vs `is_expected.to`

Note that in this README and throughout the documentation we're using the
`should` form of RSpec's one-liner syntax over `is_expected.to`. The `should`
form works regardless of how you've configured RSpec -- meaning you can still
use it even when using the `expect` syntax. But if you prefer to use
`is_expected.to`, you can do that too:

``` ruby
RSpec.describe Person, type: :model do
  it { is_expected.to validate_presence_of(:name) }
end
```

### Minitest

Shoulda Matchers was originally a component of [Shoulda][shoulda], a gem that
also provides `should` and `context` syntax via
[`shoulda-context`][shoulda-context].

At the moment, `shoulda` has not been updated to support `shoulda-matchers` 3.x,
so you'll want to add the following to your Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'shoulda', '~> 3.5'
  gem 'shoulda-matchers', '~> 2.0'
end
```

Now you can use matchers in your tests. For instance a model test might look
like this:

``` ruby
class PersonTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  should validate_presence_of(:name)
end
```

## Running tests

### Unit tests

Unit tests are the most common kind of tests in this gem, and the best way to
run them is by using [Zeus].

You'll want to run `zeus start` in one shell, then in another shell, instead of
using `rspec` to run tests, you can use `zeus rspec`. So for instance, you might
say:

```
zeus rspec spec/unit/shoulda/matchers/active_model/validate_inclusion_of_matcher_spec.rb
```

As a shortcut, you can also drop the initial part of the path and say this
instead:

```
zeus rspec active_model/validate_inclusion_of_matcher_spec.rb
```

### Acceptance tests

The gem uses [Appraisal] to test against multiple versions of Rails and Ruby.
This means that if you're trying to run a single test file, you'll need to
specify which appraisal to use. For instance, you can't simply say:

```
rspec spec/acceptance/active_model_integration_spec.rb
```

Instead, you need to say

```
bundle exec appraisal 4.2 rspec spec/acceptance/active_model_integration_spec.rb
```

### All tests

You can run all tests by saying:

```
bundle exec rake
```

## Generating documentation

YARD is used to generate documentation, which can be viewed [online][rubydocs].
You can preview changes you make to the documentation locally by running

    yard doc

from this directory. Then, open `doc/index.html` in your browser.

If you want to be able to regenerate the docs as you work without having to run
`yard doc` over and over again, keep this command running in a separate terminal
session:

    rake docs:autogenerate
