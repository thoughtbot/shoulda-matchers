[![shoulda-matchers][logo]][website]

Shoulda Matchers provides RSpec- and Minitest-compatible one-liners that test
common Rails functionality. These tests, if written by hand, would be much
longer, more complex, and error-prone.

## Getting started

### RSpec

Start by including `shoulda-matchers` in your Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'shoulda-matchers'
  gem 'rails-controller-testing'
end
```

Now you need to tell the gem a couple of things:

* Which test framework you're using
* Which portion of the matchers you want to use

You can supply this information by providing a configuration block. Where this
goes and what this contains depends on your project.

#### Rails apps

Assuming you are testing a Rails app, simply place this at the bottom of
`spec/rails_helper.rb` (or in a support file if you so choose):

```ruby
Shoulda::Matchers.configure do |config|
  config.integrate do |with|
    with.test_framework :rspec
    with.library :rails
  end
end
```

Now you're ready to use matchers in your tests! For instance, you might decide
to add a matcher to one of your models:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Person, type: :model do
  it { should validate_presence_of(:name) }
end
```

#### Non-Rails apps

If your project isn't a Rails app, but you still make use of ActiveRecord or
ActiveModel, you can still use this gem too! In that case, you'll want to place
the following configuration at the bottom of `spec/spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
Shoulda::Matchers.configure do |config|
  config.integrate do |with|
    with.test_framework :rspec

    # Keep as many of these lines as are necessary:
    with.library :active_record
    with.library :active_model
  end
end
```

Now you're ready to use matchers in your tests! For instance, you might decide
to add a matcher to one of your models:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Person, type: :model do
  it { should validate_presence_of(:name) }
end
```

For more of an idea of what you can use, [see the list of matchers
below](#matchers).

#### Availability of matchers in various example groups

Regardless of your project, it's important to keep in mind that since
shoulda-matchers provides four categories of matchers, there are four different
levels where you can use these matchers:

* ActiveRecord and ActiveModel matchers are available only in model example
  groups, i.e., those tagged with `type: :model` or in files located under
  `spec/models`.
* ActionController matchers are available only in controller example groups,
  i.e., those tagged with `type: :controller` or in files located under
  `spec/controllers`.
* The `route` matcher is available also in routing example groups, i.e., those
  tagged with `type: :routing` or in files located under `spec/routing`.
* Independent matchers are available in all example groups.

**⚠️ If you are using ActiveModel or ActiveRecord outside of Rails** and you want
to use model matchers in certain example groups, you'll need to manually include
them. Here's a good way of doing that:

```ruby
require 'shoulda-matchers'

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include(Shoulda::Matchers::ActiveModel, type: :model)
  config.include(Shoulda::Matchers::ActiveRecord, type: :model)
end
```

Then you can say:

```ruby
describe MySpecialModel, type: :model do
  # ...
end
```

#### `should` vs `is_expected.to`

Note that in this README and throughout the documentation we're using the
`should` form of RSpec's one-liner syntax over `is_expected.to`. The `should`
form works regardless of how you've configured RSpec — meaning you can still use
it even when using the `expect` syntax. But if you prefer to use
`is_expected.to`, you can do that too:

```ruby
RSpec.describe Person, type: :model do
  it { is_expected.to validate_presence_of(:name) }
end
```

### Minitest

Shoulda Matchers was originally a component of [Shoulda][shoulda], a gem that
also provides `should` and `context` syntax via
[`shoulda-context`][shoulda-context].

At the moment, `shoulda` has not been updated to support `shoulda-matchers` 3.x
and 4.x, so you'll want to add the following to your Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'shoulda', '~> 3.5'
  gem 'shoulda-matchers', '~> 2.0'
end
```

Now you're ready to use matchers in your tests! For instance, you might decide
to add a matcher to one of your models:

```ruby
class PersonTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  should validate_presence_of(:name)
end
```

For more of an idea of what you can use, [see the list of matchers
below](#matchers).
