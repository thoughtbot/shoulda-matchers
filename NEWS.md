# HEAD

* Revert previous change in `AllowValueMatcher` that added a check for a
properly-set attribute.

# v 1.5.5
* `AllowValueMatcher` checks that the right value is used for attempts at
setting the attribute with it
  * Please note that previously-passing tests might now fail. It is likely that
  it's not a bug, but please make sure that the code you're testing is written
  properly before submitting an issue.
* Use DisallowValueMatcher for `disallows_value_of` method
* Assert `class_name` value on real class name for `AssociationMatcher`
* Correct the variable used for `validate_confirmation_of` matcher description

# v 1.5.4
* Properly-released version of 1.5.3

# v 1.5.3 - yanked due to mis-release
* Alleviate the need to add `rspec` gem to your app

# v 1.5.1
* Bump version depedency of Bourne to allow for Mocha upgrade.
* Should fix incompatiblity with MiniTest.

# v 1.5.0
* Deprecate the following matchers:
  * assign_to
  * respond_with_content_type
  * query_the_database
  * validate_format_of
  * have_sent_email
  * strong_parameters_matcher
  * delegate_method

* Use RSpec's native `configure.include` syntax for including matchers into
  RSpec (#204)

* Do not force minitest loading when test-unit is available (this was fixed
  before 1.3.0 then reverted in 1.3.0) (#181)

# v1.4.2
* Added a new `delegate_method` matcher.

# v1.4.1
* Fixes an issue when used with Test::Unit on the allow value matcher.

* Fixes an issue with using `ensure_inclusion_of(:attr)` given an array of true or false values.

# v1.4.0

* Added `strict` option to validation matchers.

* Verify that arguments to `set_the_flash` matcher are valid.

* Fix issue in ValidateUniquenessMatcher that could cause an error on postgres.

* You can now pass an array to `ensure_exclusion_of` using `in_array`.

* Allow testing of `:foreign_key` option for `has_one` relationships using the association matcher.

* Fix bug where `ensure_length_of` would pass if the given string was too long.

* `allow_blank` will now allow values such as: ' ', '\n', and '\r'.

* Test outside values for `ensure_inclusion_of` when given an array.

* Fixed the output of the `set_the_flash` matcher.

# v1.3.0

* `validate_format_of` will accept `allow_blank(bool)` and `allow_nil(bool)`

* Prefer Test::Unit to Minitest when loading integrations so that RubyMine is
  happy (#88).

* `validates_uniqueness_of` will now create a record if one does not exist.
  Previously, users were required to create a record in the database before
  using this matcher.

* Fix an edge case when where the matchers weren't loaded into Test::Unit when
  mixing RSpec and Test::Unit tests and also loading both the 'rspec-rails' gem
  and 'shoulda-matchers' gem from the same Gemfile group, namely [:test,
  :development].

* `controller.should_not render_partial` now correctly matches `render partial: "partial"`.

# v1.2.0

* `ensure_inclusion_of` now has an `in_array` parameter:
  `ensure_inclusion_of(:attr).in_array(['foo', 'bar'])`. It cannot be used with
  the `.in_range` option. (vpereira)

* `ensure_in_inclusion_of` with `in_array` will accept `allow_blank(bool)` and `allow_nil(false)`

* Test against Rails 3.2.

* Fix `ensure_length_of` to use all possible I18n error messages.

* `have_db_index.unique(nil)` used to function exactly the same as
  `have_db_index` with no unique option. It now functions the same as
  `have_db_index.unique(false)`.

* In 1.1.0, `have_sent_email` checked all emails to ensure they matched. It now
  checks that only one email matches, which restores 1.0.0 behavior.

# v1.1.0

* Added `only_integer` option to `validate_numericality_of`:
  `should validate_numericality_of(:attribute).only_integer`

* Added a `query_the_database` matcher:

    `it { should query_the_database(4.times).when_calling(:complicated_method) }`
    `it { should query_the_database(4.times).or_less.when_calling(:complicated_method) }`
    `it { should_not query_the_database.when_calling(:complicated_method) }`

* Database columns are now correctly checked for primality. E.G., this works
  now: `it { should have_db_column(:id).with_options(:primary => true) }`

* The flash matcher can check specific flash keys using [], like so:
  `it { should set_the_flash[:alert].to("Password doesn't match") }`

* The `have_sent_email` matcher can check `reply_to`:
  ` it { should have_sent_email.reply_to([user, other]) }`

* Added `validates_confirmation_of` matcher:
  `it { should validate_confirmation_of(:password) }`

* Added `serialize` matcher:
  `it { should serialize(:details).as(Hash).as_instance_of(Hash) }`

* shoulda-matchers checks for all possible I18n keys, instead of just
  e.g. `activerecord.errors.messages.blank`

* Add `accept_nested_attributes` matcher

* Our very first dependency: ActiveSupport &gt;= 3.0.0
