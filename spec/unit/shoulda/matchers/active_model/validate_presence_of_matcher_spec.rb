  invalid and to produce the validation error "can't be blank" on
  :parent. The record was indeed invalid, but it produced these
  validation errors instead:

  * parent: ["must exist"]

  You're getting this error because you've instructed your `belongs_to`
  association to add a presence validation to the attribute. *This*
  presence validation doesn't use "can't be blank", the usual validation
  message, but "must exist" instead.

  With that said, did you know that the `belong_to` matcher can test
  this validation for you? Instead of using `validate_presence_of`, try
  one of the following instead, depending on your use case:

      it { should belong_to(:parent).optional(false) }
      it { should belong_to(:parent).required(true) }

  You're getting this error because you've instructed your `belongs_to`
  association to add a presence validation to the attribute. *This*
  presence validation doesn't use "can't be blank", the usual validation
  message, but "must exist" instead.

  With that said, did you know that the `belong_to` matcher can test
  this validation for you? Instead of using `validate_presence_of`, try
  one of the following instead, depending on your use case:

      it { should belong_to(:parent).optional(false) }
      it { should belong_to(:parent).required(true) }
