= shoulda-matchers

{Official Documentation}[http://rubydoc.info/github/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers/master/frames]

Test::Unit- and RSpec-compatible one-liners that test common Rails functionality.
These tests would otherwise be much longer, more complex, and error-prone.

Refer to the {shoulda}[https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda] gem if you want to know more
about using shoulda with Test::Unit.

=== ActiveRecord Matchers

Matchers to test associations:

  describe Post do
    it { should belong_to(:user) }
    it { should have_many(:tags).through(:taggings) }
  end

  describe User do
    it { should have_many(:posts) }
  end

=== ActiveModel Matchers

Matchers to test validations and mass assignments:

  describe Post do
    it { should validate_uniqueness_of(:title) }
    it { should validate_presence_of(:body).with_message(/wtf/) }
    it { should validate_presence_of(:title) }
    it { should validate_numericality_of(:user_id) }
  end

  describe User do
    it { should_not allow_value("blah").for(:email) }
    it { should allow_value("a@b.com").for(:email) }
    it { should ensure_inclusion_of(:age).in_range(1..100) }
    it { should_not allow_mass_assignment_of(:password) }
  end

=== ActionController Matchers

Matchers to test common patterns:

  describe PostsController, "#show" do
    context "for a fictional user" do
      before do
        get :show, :id => 1
      end

      it { should assign_to(:user) }
      it { should respond_with(:success) }
      it { should render_template(:show) }
      it { should_not set_the_flash }
    end
  end

= Installation

In Rails 3 and Bundler, add the following to your Gemfile:

  group :test do
    gem "rspec-rails"
    gem "shoulda-matchers"
  end

Shoulda will automatically include matchers into the appropriate example groups.
