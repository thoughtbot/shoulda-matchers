# Maintaining Shoulda Matchers

As maintainers of the gem, this is our guide. Most of the steps and guidelines
in the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) document apply here, including how to set
up your environment, write code to fit the code style, run tests, craft commits
and manage branches. Beyond this, this document provides some details that would
be too low-level for contributors.

## Communication

We have several ways that we can communicate with each other:

* In planning major releases, it can be helpful to create a **new issue**
  outlining the changes as well as steps needed to launch the release. This
  serves both as an announcement to the community as well as an area to keep a
  checklist.
* To track progress for the next release, **GitHub milestones** are useful.
* To track progress on the movement of issues, [**labels**](#labels-in-github)
  are useful.
* To communicate small-scale changes, **pull requests** are effective, as
  mentioned above.
* To communicate large-scale changes or explain topics, **email** is best.

## Managing the community

As anyone who has played a sim game before knows, it's important to make your
patrons happy. We do this by:

* Answering questions from members of the community
* Closing stale issues and feature requests
* Keeping the community informed by ensuring that the changelog is up to date
* Ensuring that the inline documentation, as well as the docsite, is kept up to
  date

## Workflow

We generally follow [GitHub Flow]. The `main` branch is the main line, and all
branches are cut from and get merged back into this branch. Generally, the
workflow is as follows:

[GitHub Flow]: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/

* Cut a feature or bugfix branch from this branch.
* Upon completing a branch, create a PR and ask another maintainer to approve
  it.
* Try to keep the commit history as clean as possible. Before merging, squash
  "WIP" or related commits together and rebase as needed.
* Once your PR is approved and you've cleaned up your branch, you're free to
  merge it in.

## Architecture

Besides the matchers, which are covered in
[Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md#matchers), there are files in `lib` which you may
need to reference or update:

* `lib/shoulda/matchers/doublespeak*` — a small handrolled mocking library
  which is used by the `permit` matcher
* `lib/shoulda/matchers/util*` — extra methods which are used in various places
  to detect library versions, wrap/indent text, and more

## Running tests

The [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) shows how to use Appraisal to run
tests. This works well if you are hopping in, making a few changes, and hopping
right out, but if you plan on working on a feature or bug, there is often a
faster alternative, at least for unit tests: [Zeus]. Zeus works by preloading
the Rails environment so that running unit tests are a lot faster. We also have
it set up to automatically select the latest Appraisal so you don't have to
provide that.

You'll want to start by running `zeus start` in one shell. Then in another
shell, instead of using `bundle exec rspec` to run tests, you'll use `bundle
exec zeus rspec`. So for instance, you might say:

```bash
bundle exec zeus rspec spec/unit/shoulda/matchers/active_model/validate_inclusion_of_matcher_spec.rb
```

This is long to say, but it helps if you add an alias to your shell:

```bash
alias zr="bundle exec zeus rspec"
```

## Issuing a new release

Every so often you may need to issue a new release. Here are the steps that we
follow to accomplish this:

1. First, [make sure you have access to publish new gems to
   RubyGems](#granting-rubygems-access).

1. Next, you'll want to [decide which version number you're about to
   release](#naming-a-new-version). In most cases, you are deciding between a
   patch release and a minor release, and you can ask whether a new
   feature is being added that didn't exist before to determine which one it
   should be.

1. Next, you'll want to [make sure that the changelog is up to
   date](#updating-the-changelog) and has a section at the top for the new
   version with all its changes and references to the appropriate pull requests
   or commits.

1. Next, [generate the documentation
   locally](#generating-and-viewing-documentation-locally) and do a quick
   spot-check (pull up the Classes and Methods menus, click around a bit) to
   ensure that nothing looks awry.

1. Next, [update the `VERSION` constant in
   `lib/shoulda/matchers/version.rb`](#naming-a-new-version). This constant is
   referenced in the gemspec and is used in the Rake tasks to publish the gem on
   RubyGems as well as generate documentation.

1. Assuming that everything looks good, place your changes to the changelog,
   `version.rb`, and README in their own commit titled "Bump version to
   *X.Y.Z*". Push this to GitHub (you can use `[ci skip]`) in the body of the
   commit message to skip CI for this commit if you so choose). **There is no
   going back after this point!**

1. Once GitHub has the version-change commit, you will run:

   ```bash
   rake release
   ```

   This will not only push the gem to RubyGems, but also publish the docs to
   GitHub Pages.

1. Finally, you'll want to make sure that GitHub's Releases section reflects the
   latest version. Copy the newest section in the changelog, [draft a new
   Release][github-releases], paste what you copied from the changelog as
   the description, then publish that release.

That's it!

[github-releases]: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository

## Updating the changelog

After every user-facing change makes it into main, we make a note of it in the
changelog, kept in `CHANGELOG.md`. The changelog is sorted in reverse order by
release version, with the topmost version as the next release (tagged as
"(Unreleased)").

Within each version, there are five available categories you can divide changes
into. They are all optional but they should appear in this order:

1. Backward-compatible changes
1. Deprecations
1. Bug fixes
1. Features
1. Improvements

Within each category section, the changes relevant to that category are listed
in chronological order.

For each change, provide a human-readable description of the change as well as a
linked reference to the PR where that change emerged (or the commit ID if no
such PR is available). This helps users cross-reference changes if they need to.

## Documentation

### Generating and viewing documentation locally

As mentioned in the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) document, we use YARD for
documentation. YARD is configured via `.yardopts` to process the Ruby files in
`lib/` as well as `CHANGELOG.md` and the Markdown files in `docs/` and write the
documentation in HTML form to `doc`. This command will generate said
documentation:

```bash
bundle exec yard doc
```

This works, but if you're actively updating the documentation, it's more helpful
to launch a process that will watch the aforementioned source files for changes
and generate the HTML for you automatically:

```bash
bundle exec rake docs:autogenerate
```

Whichever approach you take, you can view the generated docs locally by running:

```bash
open doc/index.html
```

### Publishing documentation

The Ruby documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages on a custom domain*:

<https://matchers.shoulda.io/docs>

This URL actually links to a HTML page which merely serves to automatically
redirect the visitor to the docs for the latest published version of the gem.
This version is hardcoded in the HTML page.

Generally you will update the published docs as a part of a release, but there
may be situations where you'll need to do it manually.

You can re-publish the docs for the latest version (as governed by
`lib/shoulda/matchers/version.rb`) by running:

```bash
bundle exec rake docs:publish_latest
```

This will update the auto-redirect on the index page to the latest version. For
instance, if the latest version were 4.0.0, this command would publish the docs
at <https://matchers.shoulda.io/docs/v4.0.0> and simultaneously redirect
<https://matchers.shoulda.io/docs> to this location.

However, if you want to publish the docs for a version but manually set the
auto-redirected version, you can run this instead:

```bash
bundle exec rake docs:publish[version, latest_version]
```

Here, `version` and `latest_version` are both version strings. For instance, you
might say:

```bash
bundle exec rake docs:publish[4.0.0, 3.7.2]
```

This would publish the docs for 4.0.0 at
<https://matchers.shoulda.io/docs/v4.0.0>, but redirect
<https://matchers.shoulda.io/docs> to <https://matchers.shoulda.io/docs/v3.7.2>.

*\* thoughtbot owns <https://shoulda.io>, and
they've got `matchers.shoulda.io` set up on the DNS level as an alias for
`thoughtbot.github.io/shoulda-matchers`.*

## Naming a new version

The version for the gem is stored in
[`lib/shoulda/matchers/version.rb`][version-rb]. This contains a constant which
is referenced by [`shoulda-matchers.gemspec`][gemspec].

[version-rb]: lib/shoulda/matchers/version.rb
[gemspec]: shoulda-matchers.gemspec

How do we change the version number over time? As designated in the README, we
follow [SemVer 2.0][semver]. This offers a meaningful baseline for deciding how
to name versions. Generally speaking:

[semver]: https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html

* We bump the "major" part of the version if we're introducing
  backward-incompatible changes (e.g. changing the API or core behavior,
  removing parts of the API, or dropping support for a version of Ruby).
* We bump the "minor" part if we're adding a new feature (e.g. adding a new
  matcher or adding a new qualifier to a matcher).
* We bump the "patch" part if we're merely including bugfixes.

In addition to major, minor, and patch levels, you can also append a
suffix to the version for pre-release versions. We usually use this to issue
release candidates prior to an actual release. A version number in this case
might look like `4.0.0.rc1`.

## Granting RubyGems access

In order to publish a new version of the gem to RubyGems, you will need to have
been added as an owner. If you want to give someone else these permissions, then
run:

```bash
gem owner shoulda-matchers -a <email address>
```

## Updating the landing page

The Shoulda Matchers landing page is located at:

<https://matchers.shoulda.io>

The code for this page is stored on the [`site`][site-branch] branch. There are
instructions there for maintaining and publishing it.

[site-branch]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers/tree/site

## Labels in GitHub

Considering that we work on the gem in our spare time, we've found [labels] to
be useful for cataloguing and marking progress. Over time we've added quite a
collection of labels. Here's a quick list:

[labels]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers/labels

### Labels for issues

* **Issue: Bug**
* **Issue: Feature Request**
* **Issue: Need to Investigate** — if we don't know whether a bug is legitimate
  or not
* **Issue: PR Needed** — perhaps unnecessary, but it does signal to the
  community that we'd love a PR

### Labels for PRs

* **PR: Bugfix**
* **PR: Feature**
* **PR: Good to Merge** — most of the time not necessary, but can be helpful in
  a code freeze before a release to mark PRs that we will include in the next
  release
* **PR: In Progress** — used to mark PRs that are still being worked on by the
  PR author
* **PR: Needs Documentation**
* **PR: Needs Review**
* **PR: Needs Tests**
* **PR: Needs Updates Before Merge** — along the same lines as the other
  "Needs" tags, but more generic

### Generic labels

* **Blocked**
* **Documentation**
* **Needs Decision**
* **Needs Revisiting**
* **Question**
* **Rails X**
* **Ruby X.Y**
* **UX**
