          def message
            Shoulda::Matchers.word_wrap <<-MESSAGE
              The #{matcher_name} matcher attempted to set :#{attribute_name} on
              #{model.name} to #{value_written.inspect}, but when the attribute was
              read back, it had stored #{value_read.inspect} instead.

              This creates a problem because it means that the model is behaving in a
              way that is interfering with the test -- there's a mismatch between the
              test that you wrote and test that we actually ran.

              There are a couple of reasons why this could be happening:

              * ActiveRecord is typecasting the incoming value.
              * The writer method for :#{attribute_name} has been overridden so that
                incoming values are changed in some way.

              If this exception makes sense to you and you wish to bypass it, try
              adding the `ignoring_interference_by_writer` qualifier onto the end of
              your matcher. If the test still does not pass after that, then you may
              need to do something different.
